# Birtual Machine

This is a virtual machine meant to be targeted by programming languages, but kind of works as a language in itself (see [examples](examples) for examples of code written in BASM).
It is stack-based and supports named labels, and both integer and floating-point instructions. Not all instructions work yet besides the ones used in examples.
